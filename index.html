      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>EcoInnovate Solutions was founded in 2010 by Riley McGovern, a visionary entrepreneur with a passion for sustainability. What began as a small startup offering a single recycled product has grown into a leading force in eco-friendly innovations. Over the years, weâ€™ve expanded our product range to include everything from sustainable household items to cutting-edge renewable energy solutions. Our journey has been marked by a commitment to environmental stewardship, technological advancement, and community engagement.

Driven by the belief that businesses have a responsibility to contribute to a sustainable future, Riley McGovern built EcoInnovate Solutions on the principles of reducing waste, conserving resources, and inspiring others to do the same. Today, we proudly support initiatives that align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in the areas of responsible consumption, clean energy, and sustainable cities.</p>
